This repository contains a simple command-line implementation of the game Othello (Reversi) in Python along with unit tests.

## Playing

Run `python play_othello.py` to start a two-player game in the terminal. Enter moves as `row col` using coordinates from 0 to 7. The program handles passes when no moves are available and prints the final score when the game ends.
